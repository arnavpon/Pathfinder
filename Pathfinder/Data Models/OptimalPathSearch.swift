// Utilize search, constraint propagation to find optimal path (minimize total distance)
// when we add a node to the search tree, it needs to have coordinates for us to calculate the distances between locations. Search will take exceedingly long if we need to stop to make an API request each time we add a node to the tree, so we will need some way to obtain & cache locations prior to starting the search. FOR ALL NON-UNIQUE LOCATIONS ON LIST, before search starts, send API request to find locations (up to 20) & cache them.
// we don't have a "goal" per se, so DFS won't work (no absolute goal)
// we need to expand ALL possibilities (that satisfy existing constraints),
// then see which path is the shortest & return that one
// (1) start at current location
// (2) expand search tree breadth first until ALL possibilities are exhausted
//  - to add node, check if location is unique or not
//  - if UNIQUE, add location (coordinates) to branch (as is): +1 node
//  - if NON-UNIQUE, get cached list of related locations & add EACH loc in list as node: +X nodes
//      - compute distance between previous node & current node to grow path length
//  - once a location is added to tree, remove it from "remaining" list
// (3) if returnToStart is True, end @ currentLocation as final node in each branch
//  - if not, end @ last node that is already present
// ** how to handle edge cases where data (locations) are missing **
